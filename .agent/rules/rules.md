Use Next.js 16.1.1
In Next.js 16 and above middleware.ts is replaced by proxy.ts. Same goes for Supabase middleware.ts.
Use Shadcn whenever it suits.
My default terminal is Powershell.
Always use Context7 MCP when I need library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps without me having to explicitly ask.
Never create, update or delete any data on my production environments(you can read though), like my Supabase instance or Stripe project without previously asking my permission first!
Never delete any data on my local Supabase instance without previously asking my permission first!
I use a local Supabase instance running in Docker Desktop for local development and the cloud instance for the production environment. Don't touch the production database that is updated by a Github Action after commits.
